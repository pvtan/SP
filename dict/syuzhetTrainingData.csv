ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ out of 5 stars
Ok so I felt like some of the dialogue in the beginning was a little off. But that didn't last. Also the ending dragged a bit for me. But over all I really dig this movie.

"2164","The trailer for Blockers does not do this film justice. Itâ€™s a rollercoaster of a comedy movie with genuine hilarious good humour. I must say I had a few tears of laughter. Credit to the cast &amp; director for creating such a well rounded film.
