A terribly sad film, interspersed with light, jovial moments that fit quite naturally. This mostly down to the performances of Affleck (a truly brilliant actor) and Hedges. Sparse, slow, dark and so moving. Odd music. #Netflix. 4.5/5","manchester sea terribly sad film interspersed light jovial moments fit quite naturally performances affleck truly brilliant actor hedges sparse slow dark moving odd music"
